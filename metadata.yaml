description: '"T. Tembarom, a New York street waif, who has struggled and smiled his
  way to a precarious success on a cheap newspaper, suddenly awakes to find himself
  Temple Temple Barholm, master of the ancient manor of Temple Barholm in Yorkshire,
  with all its resulting complications, amusing and otherwise. His fine sincerity
  and engaging personality and the timely appearance of a lost heir "to the manor
  born," save the situation."--Manybooks.'
